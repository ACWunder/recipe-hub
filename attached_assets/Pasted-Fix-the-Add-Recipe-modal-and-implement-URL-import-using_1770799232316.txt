Fix the “Add Recipe” modal and implement URL import using the OpenAI API.

A) Bugfix: Add Recipe modal UX
- Currently I can type into fields but the “Save” button is not clickable. Fix layout/overlay/z-index/pointer-events so the button is always tappable on iPhone.
- When scrolling down, the modal closes automatically. Remove any “close on scroll / drag down to close” behavior.
- The modal must ONLY close when the user taps the “X” (and optionally when pressing Escape on desktop).
- Ensure proper iOS safe-area handling and that content is scrollable inside the modal without cutting off bottom content. Use a sticky footer with the Save button if needed.

B) Implement “Import from URL” (fully working)
- In the Add Recipe view, add an input for a recipe URL and an “Import” button.
- Create a backend endpoint (e.g. POST /api/import-recipe) that:
  1) Fetches the HTML from the provided URL (server-side).
  2) Extracts relevant text (title, ingredients, steps) from the page. If available, also read Recipe Schema.org JSON-LD.
  3) Calls OpenAI to convert the scraped content into our canonical Recipe JSON:
     { title, description?, imageUrl?, tags: string[], ingredients: string[], steps: string[] }
  4) Returns that JSON to the client and pre-fills the form fields.
- Use streaming or loading states and show errors nicely (invalid URL, fetch blocked, parse failed).

Image handling
- First choice: use the site’s main image (OpenGraph og:image or JSON-LD “image”).
- If no image is available, generate a nice placeholder (gradient card) rather than failing.
- Do NOT require image generation via OpenAI unless absolutely necessary.

OpenAI integration (secure)
- Read the API key from environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY ONLY.
- Do NOT hardcode keys anywhere.
- Add README instructions for setting OPENAI_API_KEY in Replit and on Vercel.

OpenAI prompt/output requirements
- The OpenAI response must be strict JSON matching the schema above (no extra text).
- Validate and sanitize the model output server-side before using it.
- Keep costs low: concise system prompt, limit max tokens, and use a single call per import.

Deliverables
- Clicking Save works reliably on iPhone.
- Modal never closes on scroll.
- Import from URL fetches, parses, calls OpenAI, and pre-fills the form.
- Add tests or at least a simple server-side validation function for Recipe JSON.
