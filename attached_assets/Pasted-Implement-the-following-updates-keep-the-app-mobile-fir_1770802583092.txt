Implement the following updates (keep the app mobile-first and the existing modern UI/animations):

1) Delete recipes
- Users must be able to delete recipes they created (“mine”).
- Add a Delete action in the recipe detail view (and/or list item overflow menu).
- Confirm before deleting.
- After delete: update UI immediately (Discover stack, list, recent).

2) Recent tab filters
- Recent should have the same filter UI pattern as Discover/Recipes.
- In Recent, the filter options are ONLY:
  - “Mine”
  - “Following”
- No “All” in Recent.

3) Show recipe author when not Mine
- Whenever the current filter is “Following” (and also when viewing “All” where applicable), show the recipe’s author in small text, e.g. “by @username”.
- Do this consistently in:
  - Discover cards
  - Recipes list items
  - Recent grid/list items
- Ensure the backend returns author username for each recipe (join with User).

4) Add a “Base” filter
- Add a third filter category named “Base”.
- “Base” = recipes that shipped with the app (seed/original recipes).
- Update the data model: add a boolean like `isBase` (default false) or an enum `source: BASE | USER`.
- Seed recipes must be marked as Base.
- Filtering behavior:
  - Mine = createdByUserId == me
  - Following = createdByUserId in users I follow
  - Base = isBase == true

5) Image upload from Photos/Camera + still allow URL
- In “Add Recipe”, support 3 image input methods:
  a) Upload/select from Photos
  b) Take a photo (camera)
  c) Image URL (keep this option)
- Make the UI compact and iPhone-friendly (e.g., a small segmented control or icon buttons).
- When user uploads/takes a photo:
  - Upload it to storage and save a persistent URL in `imageUrl`.
  - Use a simple, reliable solution compatible with the current hosting plan (e.g., Supabase Storage, Cloudinary, or another easy storage provider). Add required env vars and README setup.
- Ensure the existing “Import from URL” flow still works and can populate an image when available.

Deliverables:
- Fully working delete flow.
- Recent filter matches the existing filter component style, with Mine/Following only.
- Author display “by @username” shows correctly across Discover/Recipes/Recent when applicable.
- Base filter works everywhere filters exist.
- Add Recipe supports photo upload/camera + image URL, and stores images reliably.
