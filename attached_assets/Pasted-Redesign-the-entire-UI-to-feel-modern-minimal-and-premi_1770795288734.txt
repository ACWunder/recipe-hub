Redesign the entire UI to feel modern, minimal, and premium — not formal, not corporate, not like an old website.

Keep all functionality exactly the same, but completely upgrade the visual design and UX.

Design direction:
- Mobile-first (optimized for iPhone)
- Very clean, airy layout with generous spacing
- Soft rounded corners (2xl or larger)
- Subtle shadows and depth (not heavy)
- Modern typography (e.g. Inter, SF Pro–style feeling)
- Smooth micro-interactions everywhere
- Elegant animations with Framer Motion
- No harsh borders
- No default HTML styles
- No “boxy” or outdated UI components

Visual style inspiration:
- Modern iOS apps
- Linear.app
- Notion (clean and calm)
- Apple Human Interface style
- Minimal gradients
- Soft glass / blur effects where appropriate

Specific improvements:

1) Navigation
- Replace any basic navbar with a beautiful floating bottom tab bar (iOS style).
- Rounded background with slight blur and shadow.
- Animated active tab indicator.

2) Cards
- Recipe cards should feel tactile.
- Slight scale-up on hover/touch.
- Soft gradient backgrounds if no image.
- Smooth swipe animations in Discover section (spring physics, fluid drag).

3) Discover section
- Make it feel playful and dynamic.
- Layered card stack effect.
- Smooth rotation while swiping.
- Subtle haptic-like visual feedback (color glow on swipe right).

4) Lists
- Remove boring table-style layout.
- Use modern card list with spacing.
- Tags as soft pill chips (rounded, pastel backgrounds).

5) Add Recipe form
- Clean input fields with floating labels.
- Rounded fields.
- Subtle focus states.
- Modern primary button with soft gradient.

6) Transitions
- Add smooth animated page transitions between tabs.
- Use motion layout animations for opening recipe detail.

7) Colors
- Keep my current base color palette,
  but apply it in a softer, more modern way.
- Avoid strong contrasts.
- Prefer pastel variants and layered neutrals.

8) Typography
- Clear hierarchy:
  - Large bold titles
  - Medium subtitles
  - Soft secondary text
- Improve spacing between sections.

Goal:
The app should feel like a modern startup product in 2026.
It should feel aesthetic, smooth, and delightful — not technical or default.

Do not change the backend or functionality.
Only refactor UI, styling, and animations.
